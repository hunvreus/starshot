# Agent rules

## Communication
- Keep answers concise, technical, and direct.
- If scope is partial, state exactly what is not included.

## Architecture
- Never use React Server Components, RSC-specific patterns, or `"use server"` architecture.
- Keep API route handlers thin; put validation, permissions, and database behavior in server services.
- Keep reusable UI in `src/components`, client API helpers in `src/lib`, server behavior in `src/server`, and data models in Drizzle schemas/migrations.
- Prefer small, function-first modules with explicit boundary contracts: typed inputs/outputs, side effects, error shape, and failure behavior.

## UI
- Add UI primitives through the shadcn registry: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add ...`.
- Prefer standard shadcn composition patterns.
- Keep feature UI in its feature folder; promote to shared components only when reused.

## Code style
- Prefer short names when clear.
- Keep control flow explicit; use simple deterministic structures like `Map`, arrays, and plain objects.
- Normalize loose inputs at module edges and keep error paths explicit.

## TypeScript
- Use strict boundary types, typed imports, and narrow interfaces.
- Avoid `any`; if unavoidable, keep scope narrow and document why.
- Verify dependency typings before guessing external API shapes.
- Use top-level type imports; do not change behavior just to silence dependency type errors.

## Change management
- Ask before removing behavior that appears intentional.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless explicitly requested.
- Keep user-facing bindings/config controls data-driven, not hardcoded.
- After large changes/removals, prune dead code and simplify touched dependencies.

## Testing
- Add or update focused tests when changing behavior, permissions, parsing, persistence, jobs, exports, notifications, or public/server API contracts.
- Run the narrowest useful verification first, then broader checks when the change touches shared behavior.
- For broad or cross-cutting changes, run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build`.
- Do not remove tests just to make a suite pass; fix behavior or update stale expectations deliberately.

## Documentation
- Use sentence-case Markdown headings.
- Comment only non-obvious intent, invariants, edge cases, and tradeoffs.
- Update the relevant top-level docs with behavior/config/workflow/API/architecture changes.
- Prefer editing existing docs; do not add empty categories, placeholder docs, private route catalogs, unvalidated OpenAPI specs, or a `docs/` tree unless explicitly requested.
- Keep transient notes, audits, feedback rounds, and baselines in `.tmp/`, issues, or temporary branches.
- Structure:
  - `README.md`: product overview, setup, common commands, and links.
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`: system mechanics, runtime shape, data flow, invariants, and non-obvious decisions.
  - `TODO.md`: the single unresolved-work list.
  - `CHANGELOG.md`: implemented visible changes using Keep a Changelog.
  - OpenAPI: only for stable external contracts when validation/generation keeps it correct.
